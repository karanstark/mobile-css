This project is a responsive website created as part of a task to convert a desktop-only layout into a mobile-friendly design using CSS media queries. It contains a simple HTML structure styled with modern CSS, including a gradient background, flexible layouts, and smooth hover effects for a polished look. The website automatically adjusts to different screen sizes by stacking elements vertically, resizing fonts, and scaling images within their containers when viewed on smaller devices (max-width 768px). The project was built and tested in Visual Studio Code using Chrome DevTools to ensure proper responsiveness, and it demonstrates the application of core responsive design principles such as fluid layouts, mobile navigation adjustments, and accessibility improvements. This repository contains the HTML and CSS files needed to run the site, and can be cloned or downloaded for further customization or learning purposes.
